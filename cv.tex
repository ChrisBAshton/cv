\section{Profile}

Full-stack web developer and award-winning 1\textsuperscript{st} class Software Engineering graduate (\emph{Best Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, Best Major Project}); I am a highly efficient, organised and creative individual currently working full-time for the BBC. In my spare time I run my own digital agency and am a tenor in the BBC Symphony Chorus.

\section{Key Achievements and Skills}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0.3em}

    \item \textbf{Technical leadership} –  responsible for the technical roadmap within BBC News' Visual Journalism team, recently leading the team's upgrade to a modular ES6 architecture. Collaborate across teams to devise maintainable, future-proof solutions, demonstrated by working with the News App team to agree on an API for consumption of Visual Journalism content.

    \item \textbf{Communication skills} - led BBC Visual Journalism's adoption of user stories as a communication tool and a developer aid. Regularly give well-received presentations to technical and non-technical audiences at all levels. Work effectively in scrum teams adopting agile techniques.

    \item \textbf{Automated testing} – lead maintainer of the Wraith visual regression testing tool, which has gone on to become the BBC's most-starred open-source project. Highly adept at authoring declarative Cucumber features alongside clean, reusable Ruby step definitions. Hand-built an in-house BDD framework in Node. Set up suites of automated tests in Docker on Jenkins CI.

    \item \textbf{Manual testing} – tested apps across multiple devices and browsers in my role as Test Engineer at the BBC, using exploratory techniques to validate application behaviour and responsiveness. Devised and documented an efficient manual-testing strategy, dubbed the ``Three Phase Attack'', in a well-received article published on \emph{Smashing Magazine}.

    \item \textbf{Accessibility} - currently volunteer as an Accessibility Champion at the BBC, promoting accessible web design and development within my team. Write semantic HTML5 augmented with accessibility attributes, and have experience of using schemas for structured data. Tested sites against WAI validators, colour contrast checkers, and screen readers in my role as Test Engineer.

    \item \textbf{SASS, CSS3 \& BEM} - I was the main developer of the Commonwealth Games Quiz (\emph{Best News Data App}, Data Journalism Awards 2015), featured on BBC Breakfast and most read and shared article on BBC News on the day of publication: \url{http://bbc.in/1ll3XHE}. Developed to support internationalisation, I took the initiative to translate it into Welsh: \url{http://bbc.in/1nDNxjD}

    \item \textbf{JavaScript \& Node} - expert developer of self-documenting, object-oriented, unobtrusive JavaScript developed through TDD (Mocha/Chai). Equally comfortable whether writing NPM modules in ES6 or cross-browser ES5 backwards-compatible to IE6. Developed a 3D solar system in WebGL: \url{http://chrisbashton.github.io/solar-system-webgl/source/}

    \item \textbf{Back-end web development} - highly experienced with OO PHP and MVCR architecture, using frameworks such as Zend and F3. Apply techniques such as PDO to prevent SQL injection attacks, encryption and salting for sensitive data, and have knowledge of preventing XSS attacks.

    \item \textbf{AWS} - developed a horizontally scalable, hosted webhooks platform: \url{http://githooks.io}. This side project runs on LAMP architecture on an EC2 instance, and uses a clever method for securely passing GitHub access tokens to webhooks which are executed on AWS Lambda.

    \item \textbf{WordPress} – created a number of bespoke themes and plugins, including plugins defining custom taxonomies (`app reviews'): \url{http://musicmakerapps.com}; a responsive e-commerce theme: \url{http://hover-bike.com}; and parent/child themes for related magazine websites: \linebreak\url{http://loopinglive.com} and \url{http://thevintagemusician.com}.
