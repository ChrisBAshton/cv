\section{Profile}

Award-winning 1\textsuperscript{st} class Software Engineering graduate (\emph{Best Bachelor Degree in Computer Science, Best Major Project}); I am a highly efficient, organised and creative full-stack web developer, currently working as a developer in test at the BBC. In my spare time I run my own web development company and am a tenor in the prestigious BBC Symphony Chorus.

\section{Key Achievements and Skills}

\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0.3em}

    \item \textbf{Testing} – world-class author of declarative Cucumber features alongside clean, reusable Ruby step definitions for BDD. Hand-built an in-house Cucumber framework in Node. Set up suites of automated tests inside Docker on Jenkins CI. Manually tested apps across multiple devices and browsers, using exploratory techniques to validate application behaviour and responsiveness.

    \item \textbf{Technical leadership} – taken ownership of the BBC's open-source Wraith project. Regularly assign company work to subcontractors through my own installation of JIRA, managing their time alongside project deadlines and code reviewing their work on GitHub.

    \item \textbf{Front-end web development} – developed responsive websites using industry best practices of ``mobile first'' development and progressive enhancement. Example: \url{http://reff.it}, a web app allowing users to share relevant text from long web pages.

    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0.3em}

        \item I was the main developer of the Commonwealth Games Quiz (\emph{Best News Data App}, Data Journalism Awards 2015), featured on BBC Breakfast and most read and shared article on BBC News on the day of publication: \url{http://bbc.in/1ll3XHE}. Developed to support internationalisation, I took the initiative to translate it into Welsh: \url{http://bbc.in/1nDNxjD}

        \item \textbf{JavaScript} - masterful developer of self-documenting, object-oriented, cross-browser vanilla JavaScript developed through TDD. Comfortable with publish/subscribe and MVC design patterns, jQuery, RequireJS, Jasmine/QUnit. Developed a 3D solar system in WebGL:

        \item \textbf{Accessibility} - I write clean, modular, semantic schema and HTML5 markup and only use unobtrusive JavaScript for progressive enhancement. Tested sites against WAI validators, colour contrast checkers, and using different IO interactions in my role as Test Engineer.

    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Back-end web development} - developed my own custom PHP-based CMS for a food review website: \url{http://studentmunch.com}, using a MySQL database for persistence and an Apache server configured to use SEO-friendly URLs.

    \begin{itemize}
        \setlength\itemsep{0.3em}

        \item Highly experienced with OO PHP, MVCR architecture and PHP unit tests, using frameworks such as Zend and F3. Actively use Grunt, Bash, SASS and other CLI tools to lint, compile, test and deploy applications. Use security tools such as snyck alongside my knowledge of XSS and prevention of SQL injection through PDO.

        \item \textbf{Tooling} - developed a ‘common tasks toolkit’ at the BBC, cutting the time taken to perform some tasks down from half an hour to under a minute and removing one of their last dependencies on legacy systems. Templated the ‘datapic’ format: \url{http://bit.ly/1wT6XTz}

        \item \textbf{WordPress} – expert at crafting bespoke themes and plugins, including plugins defining custom taxonomies (`app reviews'): \url{http://musicmakerapps.com}; a responsive e-commerce theme: \url{http://hover-bike.com}; and parent/child themes for related magazine websites: \url{http://loopinglive.com} and
        \url{http://thevintagemusician.com}.

    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Communication skills} - led BBC Visual Journalism's adoption of Cucumber feature files as a communication tool and a developer aid. Gave a well-received presentation to 40 developers on a technical subject while at the BBC. Work effectively in scrum teams adopting agile techniques.

\end{itemize}
